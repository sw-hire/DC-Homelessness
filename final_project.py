    st.write(
        "This model used demographic data that ranks high in relating to experiencing homelessness (especially in Washington D.C.), but the fact is that even with all the population metrics, there is a lack of data around tracking the general locations of homeless people. Most of this data is information you'd only have if you were a resident familiar with the neighborhood; otherwise, its harder to find. Initially, this project wanted to examine the proximity of public resources (like bathrooms) to homeless populations, but noticing proximity is hard when you don't have an initial location.")
    st.write(
        "Location data on homelessness could be an incredibly powerful tool for planners and policy makers to have a bigger impact. However, there is still the obvious moral dilemma of tracking the location of these people. Should we prioritize the policy or individual privacy? This question is a tricky one, but it also cannot be answered with numbers alone, and requires an understanding of the community, first and foremost.")
